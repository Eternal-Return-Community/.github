## Welcome to Eternal Return Community
- I started programming after I came across **Eternal Return** (it's been around 2 years since I started). All of my projects in this area are merely for studies and to help some members of the community that don't have access to certain endpoints. An example of endpoint is dak.gg's Leaderboard that is separated by region. 
<br> In case you want to help, contribute, teach or show a tool, feel free to. And if you want to get in contact with me, send me a message on discord **@nicaksks**. <br><br>

## Tools that I use to extract information from the game
- **[AssetStudio](https://github.com/aelurum/AssetStudio)**
- **[Il2CppDumper](https://github.com/Perfare/Il2CppDumper)** or **[Il2CppDumper-GUI](https://github.com/AndnixSH/Il2CppDumper-GUI)**
- **[dnSpy](https://github.com/dnSpy/dnSpy)**
- **[Fiddler Classic](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler/fiddler-classic)** or **[Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/)**

Some upcoming information like characters, skins, battle passes, emotes, etc.
You don't even need to extract anything from the game, all you need to do is access some endpoints of ER's public API.<br> 

You have to clone the gameData repository, then you can run the script and it'll download the necessary information so you can check the (possible) upcoming characters, skins, battle passes, emotes, etc. <br><br>
